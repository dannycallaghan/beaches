BeachesApp
==========

A sandbox app, allowing me to play with Angular. Will hopefully be in a Production state at some point, but who knows? For now, a repo to try new (Angular) things.

Please Note
Yes, I know it's not the done thing to have your node_modules, bower_components, etc in your repo, but I'm developing on a number of machines with this, so it's just easier. Should this ever reach Production, I'll tidy this up. Chill :)
